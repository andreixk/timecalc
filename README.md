# TimeCalc

A work hours/time calculator built with VueJS

Calculates hours worked.

Can accept inputs in various formats:

```bash
10         #10:00 A.M.
3pm        # 3:00 P.M.
8 A.M.     # 8:00 A.M.
12:00pm    #12:00 P.M.
11:30 A.M. #11:30 A.M.
15:00      # 3:00 P.M.
1400       # 2:00 P.M.
```

Note that if you enter a time without 'am' or 'pm' it'll assume the time is A.M. unless it's in 24 hr format

Feel free to modify it to suit your needs.
